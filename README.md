## Radical Tech - Supply Chain Buddy

The participants are required to clone this repository and create a private Gitlab repository under their own username (Single repository per team). The following created sections in this README.md need to be duly filled, highlighting the denoted points for the solution/implementation. Please feel free to create further sub-sections in this markdown, the idea is to understand the gist of the components in a singular document.

### Project Overview
----------------------------------

A brief description of 

* The problem that we tried to solve was as follows:
    * Experienced Team members and mentors spend a lot of time explaining the functionalities, the standards, the workflow and everything that would help in the transition of a new employee
    
    * Deficit of Domain knowledge across the team.
    
    * New Joinees are not able to clear their doubts effectively due to peer pressure.

* The proposed solution is:
    
    * We Designed a simple UI based on HTML and CSS mostly, to be experienced by any team member new to the company and she can navigate the UI and understand the workflow, the coding standards of the company, resolve any queries she might have and educate herself easily and be more productive on the team. 
    
    * We also are proposing a lightweight ChatBot completely based on Python to provide any kind of assisstance to all employees alike. The Query can be related to L1 type technical support, questions on the Supply Chain of the company or any general query whatsoever.
